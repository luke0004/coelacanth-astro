In September 2023, we sailed Coelacanth from the West Frisian island of Texel to England's East Coast.

After a night in Lowestoft, we sailed into the River Blyth and moored in the town of Southwold — with its working fishing boats, pub at the landing dock, 15th-century church, and lighthouse shining over the bar. From there we continued southward to the River Orwell, past the marshes and into Pin Mill, where the historic Butt & Oyster pub sits beneath the trees. We lingered at Shotley and Woolverstone before sailing home across a quieter North Sea.
